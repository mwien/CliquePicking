# The Clique-Picking Algorithm
This repository contains an implementation of the Clique-Picking algorithm that we have proposed at AAAI 2021 [1] for counting the number Markov Equivalent DAGs in polynomial time. The paper and its appendix is available on arXiv [2].

2. [arXiv version](https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.09679)

## AAAI 2021 Experiments
The implementation we used in [1] can be found under [aaai_experiments](/aaai_experiments). This folder also contains some of the graphs we used in the experiments.

## Uniform Sampling
A Julia implementation for uniform sampling of Markov Equivalent DAGs will be added soon.
