# Prototypes

This directory contains prototypes, which I implemented for [1] and [2]. More precisely:


- ```aaai_experiments/``` contains the original C++ implementation and experiments from the AAAI 2021 conference paper (only counting is implemented here)
- ```cliquepicking_julia/``` contains the subsequent Julia code additionally provides a sampling algorithm

This code is not maintained anymore and is also slower than the Python wrapped Rust code in this repository.
