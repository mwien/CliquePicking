# AAAI 2021 Experiments
The implementation of the algorithm that we used for the experiments in [1] is contained in this folder as `cliquepicking.cc`. It can be compiled with the following command:

```
g++ -O3 -march=native -lgmp -lgmpxx cliquepicking.cc
```

The solver can be run with `./a.out < <input-file>` and expects a chordal graph in the format defined below.

# Experimental Setup

Each plot in Figure 2 and Figure 3 in the appendix of [2] was
produced by running Clique-Picking on graphs generated by certain
random chordal graph generators. This folder contains the folder `instances` with 9 subfolders
named `<generator>-<parameter>` that contains the graphs produced by
`<generator>` used with density `<parameter>`. In detail:

| Folder           | Content                                                                          | Reference in Appendix |
| :--              | :--                                                                              | :--                   |
| subtree-logn     | random chordal graphs generated by the subtree intersection method with k=logn   | Section E.1           |
| subtree-2logn    | random chordal graphs generated by the subtree intersection method with k=2logn  | Section E.1           |
| subtree-sqrtn    | random chordal graphs generated by the subtree intersection method with k=sqrtn  | Section E.1           |
| interval         | random interval graphs                                                           | Section E.2           |
| peo-2            | random chordal graphs generated by the perfect elimination order method with k=2 | Section E.3           |
| peo-4            | random chordal graphs generated by the perfect elimination order method with k=4 | Section E.3           |
| thickening-3     | random chordal graphs generated by random tree thickening with k=3               | Section E.4           |
| thickening-logn  | random chordal graphs generated by random tree thickening with k=logn            | Section E.4           |
| thickening-sqrtn | random chordal graphs generated by random tree thickening with k=sqrtn           | Section E.4           |

Each folder contains 9 graphs (7 for thickening-*) with 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096 vertices (which is encoded in the instance name as `n=<x>`).
For each number of vertices, we generated 10 random graphs (encoded in the name as `nr=<x>`). 

Due to size constraints on GitHub, this repository only contains the graphs with `nr=1`. Please feel free to contact us, if you are interested in the remaining instances.

## Graph Format

Each graph on n vertices contains the vertices {1,2,...,n}. The first line of a graph file contains two space-separated integers: the number of vertices n and the number of edges m. It follows one blank line and m lines containing the edges as two space-separated integers.
